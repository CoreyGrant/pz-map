Welcome to the PZ Map Companion App  
  
https://coreygrant.github.io/pz-map-deploy/  
  
The app is currently in development, with new features being added and existing features refined. Expect bugs, but please report them if found (user reported bugs are high priority).  
  
Feature requests and feedback are welcome.  
  
Features:  
A simple map showing all of Knox County, showing buildings and roads in a clear and easily readable way. Think a combination of the in-game map, and an A-Z for easier travel and navigation.  
A breakdown of each building, listing rooms inside, and the ability to mark them as looted, survivor houses (barricaded), and bases, as well as add custom notes.  
The ability to annotate the map, so you can mark where that high-condition car is, or where the zombie workmen dropped their sledgehammer.  
A room locator, allowing you to quickly and easily see every gunstore in Knox County, or that one cookstore in Louisville.  
Multiple save support.  
And many more to come!  
  
FAQ:  
  
Q: Can I use the map on my phone?  
A: There is basic mobile support, but some things are more difficult (e.g. no pinch-to-zoom yet)  
  
Q: Can I use the map across multiple devices?  
A: Not currently, all data is stored locally to the browser. An import feature might be provided to share between devices, but full multi-device use will come with accounts  
  
Q: Why does X not work?  
A: The app is currently under development and features may be added, removed or updated.  
  
Q: I've found a bug, your app sucks  
A: Please report it via github, or once it's set up the discord server (TBA)  
  
Upcoming features:  
A loot trip planner, so you can develop a detailed plan for that Louisville trip and make sure you don't miss anything  
Basic starter guides for each town, giving you a default plan for all the best loot  
Including world objects, so you can easily find all the popsicle-freezers near your base for "recovery"  
More ways to search over the map  
An Account system so you can use the map seemlessly across devices
