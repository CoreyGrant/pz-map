Trip planner:

A view where a user can plan looting trips into other towns, in whatever way they like
More advanced map searching options:
	Can select multiple room types to have buildings containing them permanantly highlighted, using and/or logic
Buildings can be selected to go on a list, which can then be re-ordered, and the numbers will appear on the buildings
	- each building can have specific rooms selected, to show which loot is the main focus
When in this view a simplified popover is shown, where trip-specific notes can be taken, and buildings can be marked as looted/checked off the list as they go
	- checked off buildings will update the main view's looted status

New view management
Basic view
	- show/hide city names, railways, buildings, roads, toolbar text etc
Trip planning view

	Basic guides for each town, so a user can select a default loot trip which will include all the most important loot available
	Include objects with buildings, so things like popsicle fridges can be found and taken
Carryover tasks:

	Collapsing menus for mobile
